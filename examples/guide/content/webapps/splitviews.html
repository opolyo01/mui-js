<h1>Split Views</h1>

<p>
	If you are considering support for iPad, then you should take a look at the split view behavior support in mui.  Due to the increased real estate available
	on the screen, this affords you the opportunity to present a master/detail view interface.  For instance, in the iPad Mail application, the master view
	presents a list of messages, and a detail view shows the currently selected message.  Support for this dual-layout view is available in mui.
</p>

<h4>Setup</h4>

<p>
	The first step in setting up a split view layout is to define an application configuration attribute. 
	<pre><code>splitViews: { 
    layout: 'default'
}</code></pre>

	When this attribute is passed to the ApplicationController constructor, it expects you to define a master/detail relationship between the navigation controllers
	you register. To do so, define the navigation controller which you would like to designate as the master controller:
	<pre><code>var masterViewController = new mui.NavigationController({
    NAME: 'master',
    viewControllers: [ ... ]
});</code></pre>

	And your detail view controller:
	<pre><code>var detailViewController = new mui.NavigationController({
    NAME: 'detail',
    viewControllers: [ ... ]
});</code></pre>
	
	And finally, establish the relationship:
	<pre><code>masterViewController.setDetailViewController(detailViewController);</code></pre>

	Now you are setup to use split views in your app.
</p>

<h4>Loading the Detail View</h4>

<p>
	You might not want to load the detail view controller's view for every user navigation.  To determine when the Detail View Controller's loadView sequence
	will be triggered, you can override the <code class="inline">shouldLoadDetailViewController</code> method in your Master View Controller.  The argument 
	passed to this method consists of a <code class="inline">request</code> object which contains information about the current request.  Returning true or false
	in this method will dictate how the Application Controller attempts to load the Detail View Controller's view.  A sample implementation of this method might look like:
	<pre><code>/*
    request =>
    {
        "navigationController": #&lt;mui.NavigationController&gt;,
        "viewController": #&lt;mui.ViewController&gt;,
        "params": #&lt;Object&gt;
    }
*/
masterViewController.shouldLoadDetailViewController = function(request) {
    if(request.viewController.NAME == detailViewController.NAME) return true;
    return false;
};</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>Presenting the Master View Controller</h4>

<p>
	When the app is viewed in portrait mode, the master view controller is automatically hidden to allow the detail view to take up the full screen.  Your Detail View Controller 
	is notified when this event occurs, by calling the <code class="inline">willHideMasterViewController</code> method.  This method is passed 2 arguments, the Master View Controller, and
	a Button object which can be placed in the Detail View Controller's navigation bar to show a Popover element containing the master view.  Likewise, a notification is passed to the 
	Detail View Controller when the rotation back to landscape occurs.  For example, in detailViewController:
	<pre><code>willShowMasterViewController: function() {
    this.setNavigationItem('leftBarItem', null);
},

willHideMasterViewController: function(masterViewController, button) {
    this.setNavigationItem('leftBarItem', button);
}</code></pre>
