      <h3>Another Javascript Library?</h3>
      <p>This may be the first question you ask.  Why do we need another Javascript library? Especially when you consider the fact that mobile browsers tend to be the first adopters of HTML5 and CSS3...</p>
      <p>The goal of mui is not to normalize differences in the DOM between different classes of browsers.  Instead, since the target device class supports standard DOM interfaces, mui places more focus on application development.  However, it does include corelibraries for DOM, Event, Ajax, and the like, which you would expect from a library such as jQuery or YUI.</p>
      <p>In addition to the bare minimum set of utilities one might need, are out-of-the-box UI controls which you can use in your web application. From buttons to tabs to scroll views, mui provides a set of controls which will make your web site feel more like an app.</p>
      <p>And to help create the application experience on the web is a framework for building rich apps. Built off the MVC pattern used by Apple in the iPhone OS, mui provides the scaffolding you need to get a web app up and running which really does feel native.</p>
