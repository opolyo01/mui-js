<h1>Object Oriented mui</h1>
<p>
	There are several language helpers which allow you to write object-oriented Javascript.
</p>

<h4>provide</h4>
<p>
	This method ensures that a namespace exists.  This works with nested namespaces.  For instance:
	<code>
		mui.provide('MyCompany.MyTeam.Me');
	</code>
	will make sure the following object tree is available. If a level in the tree does not exist, it will initialize an empty object.
	<pre><code>MyCompany {
    MyTeam: {
        Me: {}
    }
}</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>bind</h4>

<p>
	Binding methods to execution context and arguments is one of the most commonly used tasks in Javascript.  <code class="inlinle">mui.bind()</code> does just that.
	It accepts a method, execution context, and a variable list of arguments to be passed to the method when it is invoked.  For instance, to bind the method <code class="inline">doSomething()</code>
	to <code class="inline">myObject</code>:
	<pre><code>mui.bind(doSomething, myObject, arg1, arg2, arg3);</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>extend</h4>
<p>
	Allows for extension of the prototype and static members of one class to another.  In addition, the superclass and constructor
	properties are setup on the parent and child classes.  For example, let's create a Person class:
	<pre><code>function Person(data) {
    // Set the name property on this instance
    this.name = data.name;
}
	</code></pre>
	Next, create an Employee class which extends Person, and adds a new property, id:
	<pre><code>function Employee(data) {
    // Set the id property on this instance
    this.id = data.id;

    // Call the superclass' constructor 
    Employee.superclass.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
}
mui.extend(Employee, Person, {
    // Prototype method getId returns the ID number of this Employee
    getId: function() {
        return this.id;
    }
});</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>mix</h4>

<p>
	Mixins allow you to add behavior to an existing class through another class.  This is typically used when there exists a set of shared
	methods and properties which might be used by multiple classes.  In this case, you can use <code class="inline">mui.mix()</code> to 
	add prototype and static members from one class to another.
</p>

<h4>augment</h4>

<p>
	If you want to add the static members from one class to another class, use <code class="inline">mui.augment()</code>.  This method only 
	augments the object's static, or instance, properties and methods.
</p>

<h4>augmentProto</h4>

<p>
	Similar to <code class="inline">augment()</code>, this method adds one class or object's prototype members to another.
