MUI Testing README
------------------

Mui testing is executed via the ant file in this directory, which is a subant task of the main mui build file.

For now the tests themselves are run on the dev mac box gavegrayhome-lm.corp.yahoo.com, which requires the selenium RC server to be running.  Iain/Matt or Mark know the password etc.  This is a laptop and will not restart in the event of power going out etc., but can be started using java -jar /usr/local/bin/selenium-server.jar.

The tests are launched via the YUITest selenium client driver after the files are scp'd to the machine for access via a file:/// URL.  Passphrase-less keys for user buildmob are set up.

As of Dec 23 2009 both the selenium driver and the javascript for YUItest are not released to production, so are have been built/aggregated from github and included in this directory.  Coverage does not yet work for the selenium driver.

Desired improvements etc.:

* make paths in and build file into properties
* use another deploy solution other than passphraseless keys
* use permanent server not laptop (perhaps consider existing windows farms)
* move test .js and .jar out of mui dir and put in central location for sharing between other tests
* clean up files after testing
* ...more to add here...
