<h1>The <span class="code">mui</span> object</h1>
<p>
	It's important to understand that any time you use mui, you access it from a single global object, called <span class="code">mui</span>.
</p>
<p>
	All components are flattened under this single object.  So whether you are using a DOM helper, or a Button control, you access it under the 
	global mui object.
