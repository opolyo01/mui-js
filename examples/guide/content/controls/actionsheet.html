<h1>Action Sheet</h1>

<p>
	The Action Sheet presents a set of action buttons in an overlay which slides up from the bottom of the screen.
	Action Sheets should be used when you need to present the user with a choice of decisions, for instance, an action
	menu in a mail message might give the user the option to reply, reply all, or forward the message. 
</p>

<p>
	Action Sheets can have an optional title, and 3 types of buttons.  The cancel button allows the user to dismiss the 
	control, and the destructive button is presented with a strong style to indicate a destructive action (such as deleting a mail).
	You can also use a variable number of "default" buttons, which are bound to some action.

<pre><code>// Create the Action Sheet
var myActionSheet = new mui.ActionSheet({
    title: 'Blah blah blah',
    cancelButton: { title: 'Cancel' },
    destructiveButton: { title: 'Alert!', action: myAlertMethod },
    otherButtons: [
        { title: 'Option 1', action: '/options/1' },
        { title: 'Option 2', action: myOption2 }
    ]
});

// Show it (slide up from the bottom)
myActionSheet.show();</code></pre>
